## Requirements
We recommend that you use `Add Number` when you install Tacky so he can provide you with the full experience. Additionally, you will need to poulate the config file with the necessary twilio info: You will need a phone number with SMS and Voice in the form +447XXXXX... and your account SID and AuthToken.
Run `Preferences: Open Settings (UI)` and Search 'Thumbtack'
